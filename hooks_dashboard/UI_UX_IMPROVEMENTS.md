3. **Test early and often**: Use the existing test data functionality
4. **Gather feedback**: Share screenshots with users after each task
5. **Measure impact**: Track the success metrics defined above

## Development Setup

```bash
# Start development server
./gradlew installDebug

# Run with test data for UI development
# Use the test mode toggle in the app

# Build and test
./gradlew assembleDebug
adb install app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

## Implementation Notes

- **Preserve existing functionality**: All current features must continue working
