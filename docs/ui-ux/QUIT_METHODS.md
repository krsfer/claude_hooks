## Technical Implementation

### Exit Method Used
All quit methods call `finishAndRemoveTask()` which:
- Completely terminates the activity
- Removes the app from the recent apps list
- Cleans up all resources
- Ensures complete shutdown

### Full-Screen Considerations
Even in full-screen immersive mode:
- The quit button remains accessible
- Back button gestures work normally
- Long-press interactions function properly
- System bars can be swiped to reveal for standard Android navigation

## Troubleshooting

### If Quit Button Not Visible
1. **Swipe down** from the top to temporarily show system bars
2. **Look for the red exit icon** in the top-right corner
3. **Use alternative methods** like double-back or long-press

### If App Won't Quit
1. Use Android's force stop in Settings
2. Clear the app from recent apps
3. Restart the device if necessary

## User Experience Notes

- **No Confirmation Dialog**: All quit methods exit immediately for quick workflow
- **State Not Saved**: Exiting loses current filter/view state
- **Background Service**: If using background service mode, service continues after app exit
- **Quick Restart**: App can be immediately relaunched from launcher

This multi-method approach ensures users can always exit the app conveniently, even in full-screen immersive mode.
